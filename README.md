### 🧠 How It Works

* The board is a 3x3 grid, managed using a single array of 9 elements.
* Game state is updated using React’s `useState`.
* Winner is calculated based on predefined combinations.
* Every time a move is made, a fun/random message is displayed on the top-left corner.
* Players can also jump to any previous move.
